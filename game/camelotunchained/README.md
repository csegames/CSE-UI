> Camelot Unchained UI 2.0

This is the repository for the official UI modules in [Camelot Unchained](http://camelotunchained.com).
This is the entire front-end UI for the game, not a partial stripped-down version.
This is what we're going to ship and we will take pull requests from the community seriously.
